# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest code on the `main` branch and the most recent released versions.

If you are using an older release, please consider upgrading before reporting an issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

- Go to the repository page
- Click **Security** → **Report a vulnerability**

If private reporting is not available for any reason, please open an issue with minimal details and ask maintainers for a private channel.

## Disclosure Policy

We will acknowledge receipt of your report and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.
