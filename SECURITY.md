# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest code on the `main` branch and the most recent released versions.

If you are using an older release, please consider upgrading before reporting an issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

- https://github.com/Raizo-TCS/archive_r/security/advisories/new

- Go to the repository page
- Click **Security** → **Report a vulnerability**

If private reporting is not available for any reason, please open an issue with minimal details and ask maintainers for a private channel.

## Disclosure Policy

We will acknowledge receipt of your report and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.

### What to include

Please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and its security impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)
- Affected versions and environments
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

### Timeline expectations

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days

If a coordinated disclosure is appropriate, we will propose a timeline and keep you updated until a fix is released.
